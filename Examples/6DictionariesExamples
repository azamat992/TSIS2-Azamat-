#1 Create and print a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

#2 Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

#3 Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict)

#4 Print the number of items in the dictionary:
print(len(thisdict))

#5 String, int, boolean, and list data types:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}

#6 Print the data type of a dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict))

#7 Using the dict() method to make a dictionary:
thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict)

#8 Get the value of the "model" key:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"]

#9 Get the value of the "model" key:
x = thisdict.get("model")

#10 Get a list of the keys:
x = thisdict.keys()

#11 Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.keys()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "white"
print(x) #after the change

#12 Get a list of the values:
x = thisdict.values()

#13 Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change
car["year"] = 2020
print(x) #after the change

#14 Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"
print(x) #after the change

#15 Get a list of the key:value pairs
x = thisdict.items()

#16 Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x) #before the change
car["year"] = 2020
print(x) #after the change

#17 Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the items list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.items()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"
print(x) #after the change

#18 Check if "model" is present in the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
if "model" in thisdict:
  print("Yes, 'model' is one of the keys in the thisdict dictionary")

#19 Change the "year" to 2018:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["year"] = 2018

#20 Update the "year" of the car by using the update() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"year": 2020})

#21 
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)

#22 Add a color item to the dictionary by using the update() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.update({"color": "red"})

#23 The pop() method removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.pop("model")
print(thisdict)

#24 The popitem() method removes the last inserted item (in versions before 3.7, a random item is removed instead):
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.popitem()
print(thisdict)

#25 The del keyword removes the item with the specified key name:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict["model"]
print(thisdict)

#26 Incorrect. The del keyword can also delete the dictionary completely:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
del thisdict
print(thisdict) #this will cause an error because "thisdict" no longer exists.

#27 The clear() method empties the dictionary:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict.clear()
print(thisdict)

#28 Print all key names in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(x)

#29 Print all values in the dictionary, one by one:
for x in thisdict:
  print(thisdict[x])

#30 You can also use the values() method to return values of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.values():
  print(x)

#31 You can use the keys() method to return the keys of a dictionary:
for x in thisdict.keys():
  print(x)

#32 Loop through both keys and values, by using the items() method:
for x, y in thisdict.items():
  print(x, y)

#33 Make a copy of a dictionary with the copy() method:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = thisdict.copy()
print(mydict)

#34 Make a copy of a dictionary with the dict() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
mydict = dict(thisdict)
print(mydict)

#35 Create a dictionary that contain three dictionaries:
myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

#36 Create three dictionaries, then create one dictionary that will contain the other three dictionaries:
child1 = {
  "name" : "Emil",
  "year" : 2004
}
child2 = {
  "name" : "Tobias",
  "year" : 2007
}
child3 = {
  "name" : "Linus",
  "year" : 2011
}
myfamily = {
  "child1" : child1,
  "child2" : child2,
  "child3" : child3
}

#37 Print the name of child 2:
print(myfamily["child2"]["name"])
